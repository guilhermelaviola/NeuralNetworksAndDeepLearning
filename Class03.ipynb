        "# **Deep Neural Networks**\n",
        "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are a major advancement in artificial intelligence, forming the foundation of deep learning by using multiple hidden layers to model complex, non-linear data. Inspired by the layered processing of the human brain, DNNs analyze information hierarchically, enabling high performance in tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing, and pattern detection. Their rapid development since around 2010 was driven by improved hardware and landmark successes in areas like computer vision, leading to specialized architectures such as CNNs and RNNs. While DNNs offer powerful capabilities through algorithms like gradient descent and backpropagation, they also present challenges, including the need for large datasets, risks of overfitting, and limited interpretability. Despite these limitations, DNNs are widely used in applications ranging from autonomous vehicles and medical diagnostics to virtual assistants and financial analysis, making them essential tools in modern AI when applied responsibly."
