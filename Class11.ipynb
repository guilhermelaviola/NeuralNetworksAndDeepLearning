        "# **Deep Dream**\n",
        "Deep Dreams are a creative application of neural networks that transform images by amplifying learned visual patterns, resulting in surreal and artistic outputs. Introduced by Google in 2015, the technique builds on deep learning concepts such as convolutional neural networks and uses pre-trained models like Inception, VGG, or ResNet to interpret images. Unlike traditional machine learning, Deep Dream algorithms use gradient ascent to maximize neuron activations rather than minimize error, enhancing specific features in an image. While Deep Dreams are valuable for artistic exploration, education, and understanding how neural networks perceive visuals, they are computationally intensive and require advanced technical knowledge, though ongoing advancements are making them more accessible."
