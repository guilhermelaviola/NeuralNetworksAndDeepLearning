# Neural Networks & Deep Learning
My school homework from **#DescomplicaDigital** on Neural Networks & Deep Learning. Neural Networks are brain-inspired computing systems with interconnected nodes (neurons) in layers, while Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning that uses deep neural networks (with many hidden layers) to automatically learn complex patterns from vast amounts of data, enabling advanced AI tasks like image recognition and natural language processing. Essentially, neural networks are the core technology, and deep learning refers to using these networks when they have multiple layers to solve complex problems.
