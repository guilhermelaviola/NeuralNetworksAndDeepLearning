        "# **Applications of Artificial Neural Networks**\n",
        "Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are computational models inspired by the human brain that play a key role in modern technology, excelling at tasks such as pattern recognition, prediction, and decision-making. They are widely applied across fields like finance, healthcare, and everyday technologies such as virtual assistants and image recognition systems. ANNs learn from data by adjusting connections between artificial neurons, becoming more accurate over time. Python, supported by rich libraries and platforms like Google Colab, has become the primary language for developing and experimenting with ANNs. While their potential is vast and transformative, responsible and ethical use with human oversight remains essential to ensure these tools benefit society."
